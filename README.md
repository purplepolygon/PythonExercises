# Coding Exercises


This is a repo that is used to destress or expand the mind.
The truth will set you free.

## About this repository

This is where I practice my algorithms and data structures.

If you are a prospective employer and would like to see my best work, I highly recommend you visit the Cracking the Coding Interview section of the repo.

That is currently my most recent and best work.

There are currently 4 sections:

### I. Cracking the coding interview

### II. MIT 6.0001

### III. Old - Codewars

### IV. Project Euler


## Future plans

I hope to constantly keep this repository updated throughout my career. I can't wait to see what it will look like in 10, 15, or 20 years!

Right now it's almost all python however I can code in Javascript or php as well.

## Resources I recommend:

freecodecamp.org - Absolutely fantastic beginner resource. The short, concise lessons keep you engaged and give you bite sized chunks of data to process.
I still visit these tutorials from time to time especially if I'm a bit rusty or haven't used a particular language/framework in a while.

MIT Open Courseware - 6.0001 Introduction to Computer Science - A top resource from one of the top universities. Their video tutorials are great.

Cracking the Coding Interview Book by Gayle Laakmann McDowell - I recommend to use this book before doing any Leetcode or programming challenges.

https://automatetheboringstuff.com/ - Automate the Boring Stuff is absolutely fantastic. You can get things that could otherwise take hours or even days done in minutes.

Get 2-3 wins from a script you wrote and you'll be hooked!

# Codew4rs Algorithms

## Introduction

**If you're reading this to decide to hire me, please check out my more recent stuff!**

First attempts at some algorithm/data structure type questions! This code is pretty sloppy and more than likely will not be updated as I moved to a more comprehensive platform - Leetcode.

While these files took me hours and hours to go initially, they are much much easier today!

## Todo?

Perhaps I may refactor and write tests demonstrating edge cases. Probably not though since these were submitted through the website.

Update: After writing this Readme and checking to see which files are actually completed, I went ahead and refactored most of them. No tests or timing or anything crazy though!

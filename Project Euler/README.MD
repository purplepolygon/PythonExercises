## About

I'd like to talk about Project Euler and how enjoyable it is. If you want to skip this part, you may. Ok, all done!

## Status:
Problems 1-10 are complete.
Problems 15, 17, 18 are not complete.
Need to add if _\_name__ == '_\_main__': to missing problems.
Need to add - TimeIt!
Need to look into Sieve of Atkin as possibly faster than Eratosthenes for small prime generation.

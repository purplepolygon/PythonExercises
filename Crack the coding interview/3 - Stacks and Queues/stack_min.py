# Stack Min: How would you design a stack which, in addition to push and pop, has a function min
# which returns the minimum element? Push, pop and min should all operate in 0(1) time.

# class MinStack:
#     def __init__(self):
#         self.values = []
#
#     def push_min(self, element):
#         if len(self.values) == 0:
#             self.values.push(element, element)
#             return self.values
#         else:
#             if element > self.values[]]

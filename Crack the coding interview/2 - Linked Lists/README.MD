## Introduction

Chapter Two from Cracking the Coding Interview.

I almost considered skipping this chapter entirely seeing as linked lists are very rare these days and setting up everything took many, many hours.

Like anything though, enough grit and determination will carry you through to the other side, and always makes up for innate "talent".

# Arrays and Strings

## Introduction

Chapter One from Cracking the Coding Interview.

## TODO:

File system is messed up, init files aren't in place. Want to make sure all algo's have both naive solution as well as optimized. Time and space complexity as well. Timing/benchmarks would be pretty cool too!

Also adding some unit tests would be great as well as replacing hardcoded earlier examples.

There were some other things but alas, it's time to rest...

Although they probably won't be used as frequently, as, say, React components, I do predict that once you have a few hundred of these lying around you're bound to use them at some point in your workspace.

Might as well do the job as thoroughly as possible since there is 0 deadline!

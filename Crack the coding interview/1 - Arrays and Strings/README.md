## TODO:

Sloppy commit. Going to configure Precommit.
File system is messed up, init files aren't in place. Want to make sure all algo's have both naive solution as well as optimized. Time and space complexity as well. Timing/benchmarks would be pretty cool too!

Also adding some unit tests would be great as well as replacing hardcoded earlier examples.

There were some other things but alas, it's time to rest...
